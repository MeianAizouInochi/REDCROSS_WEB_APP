                    <p className="aboutusbodyheadings"><strong>Founder of red cross society</strong></p>
                <p>The Red Cross came into being at the initiative of a man named Henry Dunant, who helped wounded soldiers at the battle of Solferino in 1859 and then lobbied political leaders to take more action to protect war victims.</p>
                <p>The Main objective/idea for formation of red cross society in early times:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It would act as a treaty that would oblige armies to care of all wounded soldiers</li>
                    <li>It will establish the creation of national societies that would help the military medical services.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Dunant's ideas found a positive response among leaders and benefactors, welfare groups and the public. In the following years, national societies were established throughout Europe.</p>
                <p>The Geneva Convention was later adapted to include wounded, sick and shipwrecked in warfare at sea, and governments adopted other laws (such as the Hague Conventions) to protect war victims.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the ICRC expanded its own work, undertaking new activities such as visiting prisoners of war and transmitting lists of names, so that their families could be reassured.</p>

                    <p className="aboutusbodyheadings"><strong>International Committee of the Red Cross</strong></p>

                <p>The core tasks of the committee are:</p>

                    <li>to organize nursing and care for those who are wounded on the battlefield</li>
                    <li>to supervise the treatment of prisoners of war and make confidential interventions with detaining authorities</li>
                    <li>to help with the search for missing persons in an armed conflict</li>
